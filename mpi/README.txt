Project Files for Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization in Parallel in MPI

This code was written for a course in parallell programming in 2018.
There are 4 implementations. They all do the equivalent thing, but
with slight variations. 

Here I have excluded the original report associated with this code,
and code evaluation.

MPI is of course required to run this code.
