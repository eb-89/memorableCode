# memorableCode
Small pieces of code that are memorable to me in some way. Many of these have associated LaTeX reports, not stored here. 

Currently the following are available:

## ahardproblem	

This is some java code that solves a tricky problem really efficiently by using
a couple of interesting algorithms. The entire problem description is in the code files.

Dependencies: None, its just pure java.

## csv	

This is a small csv-handling piece of code at one point written for school.
It can do some basic operations on the data like searching and sorting.
Implements mergesort. Does some regex matching.

Dependencies: None, its just pure java.

## knnClassification

This code was written for a classification project. It mostly does a lot of 
data preprocessing before it feeds the data (not stored here) to the sk-learn
knn-classifier. There is some SGD associated with learning a Mahalanobis metric here.

Dependencies: scikit-learn, numpy

## mpi	

This is a parallellization of the classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm in MPI.
Performs pretty well.

Dependecies: mpi

## sift

This is some code written for a computer vision projects that detects keypoints in a face by using
support vector machines. Data is not provided here.

Dependecies: scikit-learn, opencv, numpy

## More coming
